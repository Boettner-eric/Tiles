### Themes
* Since this version of tiles is customization focused I omitted the default themes.
* To add them to your page I included the colors for the original themes and the file [themes.txt](themes.txt) contains commands you can copy and paste into the search bar for each theme.

### Hosting Notes
- The server is set to be most responsive from 8-24 PST.
- My hosting goes through a sleep schedule so initial response times will be delayed for requests outside of that time range.
- Maintenance will occur during these evening periods.

### Icons8
To add an icon for a tile/page/theme:
- Go to [icons8.com](icons8.com)
- Search for the icon you want (set the style to color)

![Icons8 search](Screenshots/search.png)
- Click on the icon you want and find the icons real name

![Icons8 search](Screenshots/icon.png)

- Use this icon name in your command or in the input form

    `!tile https://google.com Google Search ~google-logo`


## Notes
* Backend will be open-sourced in the next few weeks.
* Spaces are replaced by `-` in commands. (use normal spaces in forms)
    * ex. `!tile url Bon-Ap√©tit Recipes ~cooking`
* There are still some bugs involving pages longer than the grid
* If you run into some bug involving blank tiles reload the page and it should resolve.
* I would recommend leaving the `Themes` and `Search` pages on your homepage to hold all theme and search tiles.

 (If you don't themes and searches will still function but the page to edit them will be unreachable)
* Feel free to reach out if you have any questions/bugs.
