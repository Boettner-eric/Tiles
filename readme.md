### Themes
* Since this version of tiles customization focused I omitted the default themes.
* To add them to your page I included commands for most of the old themes here. (just copy and paste each line into the search bar)

```
!theme Discord Purple-Black-Grey ~discord-logo #23272A #2C2F33 #7289DA #99AAB5 #7289DA

!theme Skeletor Green-Purple-Green ~thriller #2b2836 #93b4ff #bd93f9 #ffffff #84fba2

!theme Gogh Blue-Green-Yellow ~field #0375B4 #007849 #FECE00 #FFFFFF #FFFFFF

!theme Todoist Grey-Red-Yellow ~reminders #1f1f1f #fccf1b #cd5650 #ffffff #ffffff

!theme Switch Grey-Red-Blue ~nintendo-switch #414548 #ff4554 #00c3e3 #ffffff #ffffff

* The format for themes is `background/image, main color, complementary color, title text, subtitle text`

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Function | Key | Description
--- | --- | ---
up | `k` / `up` | up one tile
down | `j` / `down` | down one tile
left | `h` / `left` | left one tile
right | `l` / `right` | right one tile
hop | `1...0`, `-`, `+` | hop to any tile #
search | `[space]` | starts live search
api search | `/` | searches external sources
themes | `\` | opens theme menu
enter | `[enter]` | go to tile / exit search
esc | `[esc]` | close search, return to homepage


## Setup
* `!register username password`
* Customize page configuration and user settings with commands

### Getting Started
- On first login a user's page will only include the theme and search folders.
- To make the process easier for a first time user I added the following commands for a default configuration.

```javascript
!register username password // create a new user
!search www.google.com/search?q= Google Search ~google-logo // create a tile for google on current page
!folder Media Streaming ~3d-glasses // adds a media page
!theme Gogh Blue-Green-Yellow ~field #0375B4 #007849 #FECE00 #FFFFFF #FFFFFF // adds a new theme
!set theme Gogh // sets new theme as main theme
!set grid 4 3 // sets a 4x3 grid for tiles
```

## Hosting Notes
- The server is set to be most responsive from 8-24 PST.
- My hosting goes through a sleep schedule so initial response times will be delayed for requests outside of that time range.
- Maintenance will occur during these evening periods.

### Icons8
To add an icon for a tile/page/theme:
- Go to [icons8.com](icons8.com)
- Search for the icon you want (set the style to color)

![Icons8 search](Screenshots/search.png)
- Click on the icon you want and find the icons real name

![Icons8 search](Screenshots/icon.png)

- Use this name in your command

    `!tile https://google.com Google Search ~google-logo`
- Make sure to use the tilde in front of the image name

## Notes
* Backend will be open-sourced in the next few weeks.
* Spaces are replaced by `-` in commands.
    * ex. `!tile url Bon-Ap√©tit Recipes ~cooking`
* There are still some bugs involving pages longer than the grid
* If you run into some bug involving blank tiles reload the page and it should resolve.
* I would recommend leaving the `Themes` and `Search` pages on your homepage to hold all theme and search tiles.

 (If you don't themes and searches will still function but the page to edit them will be unreachable)
* Feel free to reach out if you have any questions/bugs.
