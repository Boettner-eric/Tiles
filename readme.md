### Data structure
#### Tile syntax
There are 3 types of tile that all use similar syntax:
1. Tiles represent static webpages. `["url","icn","title","subtitle"]`
2. Folders represent a key for a array of tiles.
`["#key-name","icn","title","subtitle"]`
3. Themes repersent tiles for a given theme name
`["$theme-name","icn","title",["background","main color","alt color","main text","subtext"]]`
4. Themes can also have background images
`["$theme-name","icn","title",["image_url","main color","alt color","main text","subtext"]]`
5. References represent simple tiles for duplicate entries
`["~Title"]` for a given tile in `pages["~"]`

```js
Example
  tile = ["https://github.com","gh","Github","Code"]
  folder = ["#","mt","Code","~/hack.sh"]
  theme = ["$","ds","Discord","Purple, Black, Grey",['#23272A','#2C2F33','#7289DA','#7289DA','#99AAB5']]
  wallpaper = ["$","pnr","Starry Night","Blue Green Yellow",["src/wall/starry.jpg","#007849","#FECE00","#FFFFFF","#FFFFFF"]]
  reference = ["~Github"]
```
Both themes and tiles are stored in lib.js -> look there for more info and examples
